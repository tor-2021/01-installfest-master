### Welcome to JavaScript Development! (10 min)

This course covers the fundamental concepts of JavaScript. 

#### Introduction

The instructional team should have already introduced themselves (or have been introduced by the course producer) at the beginning of class. At this point, you should give students the opportunity to introduce themselves.

### Fundamentals of JS & Web Development (50 min)

#### JS & Web Tech (5 min)

Let's start by defining a few terms and situating JavaScript in the broader Web ecosystem:

* _Web Development_: The process of building sites and applications for the Web.
* _Front-End Development_: The development of client / browser code (HTML, CSS, JS), i.e., what the user sees and interacts with.
* _Back-End Development_ : The development of server-side code that handles such functions as routing, data handling, and databases (Ruby, Python, Java, Javascript), i.e., the “stuff behind the scenes” that makes Web applications work.

In this class, you will be learning both functional and object-oriented programming (OOP). Understanding the core differences between these two programming paradigms is essential to understanding the concepts in this class and, ultimately, becoming a more efficient programmer.

#### Object Oriented & Functional Programming (5 min)

* OOP focuses on structuring imperative code. It creates models of various concepts in a given problem area, then applies them. These models ("objects") are given functionality ("methods") that enable them to perform various actions; each object can also hold information. The fundamental unit in OOP is the object, which can itself contain further objects, like a Russian Matryoshka doll. The idea is to make it easier for human programmers to visualize the program by tying the program to concrete things, which helps the programmer group things logically. **The fundamental thing to remember is that in object-oriented programming, _everything_ is an object and every object has methods that allow the programmer to access its functionality.**

* Functional programming treats the problem area as a sequence of equations ("functions")--essentially, a progression of definitions that lead to the answer. The information begins as a number of axioms and culminates in the answer. (Think of it as a logical argument that ends in what you see on the screen.) Functional programming borrows many concepts from formal mathematics, and, as in mathematics (and unlike imperative programming or OOP), it usually does not save data between steps. **The fundamental unit in functional programming is the function, which can perform operations as well as produce further functions.**

#### Internet vs. World Wide Web (10 min)

The Internet and the World Wide Web are very different entities; however, the terms are often used interchangeably. We will clarify some of the misconceptions about the two. Try to answer the following questions first:  

* What do you think the World Wide Web is? How is it different from the Internet?
* Can you think of an analogy to describe the difference between the two?
* Who controls the Internet?

##### The Internet is a Big Collection of Computers and Cables

”Internet” is short for "interconnection of computer networks." It consists of millions of personal, business, and government computers, all connected like roads and highways. In essence, it's an infrastructure that connects millions of computers around the world together. The Internet as you know it ultimately boils down to a series of requests and responses; you send information out to the Web, and you receive corresponding information back.

No single person owns the Internet, and no single government has authority over its operations. Some technical rules and hardware/software standards enforce how people plug into the Internet, but for the most part, the Internet is a free and open broadcast medium.

##### The Web Is a Big Collection of HTML Pages on the Internet

The World Wide Web, or "Web" for short, is a massive collection of digital documents in the form of HTML pages. The Web is viewed by using free software called Web browsers. Created in 1989, the Web is based on hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), the language which allows us to "jump" from one public Web page to another via links. There are more than 65 billion public Web pages on the Web today.

The World Wide Web is, in essence, the conduit through which most of us access information over the Internet. It is software that runs on top of the Internet, enabling us to access HTML content.

#### Client - Server Model (30 min)

***Question: How exactly does communication between computers and networks take place?***

>Note: Ask students to create a diagram of the client-server model on a whiteboard and explain their reasoning. When they are done, provide your own explanation. Then explain how the following terms relate to one another: host, client, HTTP, request, response. Draw/pull up the diagram below as needed.  

Communication between a host (such as a computer) and a client (a requesting program, such as a browser) occurs via a request/response pair. The client initiates an HTTP request message, which is serviced through an HTTP response message. Simply put, the client makes a request and the server responds accordingly.

A server may receive requests from many different clients in a very short period of time. Because the computer can perform only a limited number of tasks at any moment, it relies on a scheduling system to prioritize and accommodate incoming requests in turn. To prevent abuse and maximize uptime, the server's software limits how a client can use the server's resources. Even so, a server is not immune to abuse. A denial of service attack exploits a server's obligation to process requests by bombarding it with requests incessantly. This inhibits the server's ability to respond to legitimate requests.

Of course, this is a somewhat abstract explanation of how this all works. Getting your request message to the right place and delivering the intended information is a highly complex process involving many intricacies.

![WebStack](img/Client-server-model.png)

- **Host** - A computer or other device connected to a computer network; the host may offer information resources, services, and applications (via computer code) to users or other computers on the network.
  - Ex: servers and Web services


- **Client** - The requesting program in the client/host relationship; the client initiates an HTTP request message, which is serviced through an HTTP response message in return.
  - Ex: browsers, terminals, mobile devices


- **HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)** -  Because this is  a protocol, it enables communication among various computers and supports an array of network configurations. To make this possible, HTTP assumes very little about a particular system.
    - Read this as: "HTTP makes it easy for many different computers to talk to each other."

_Text From [Tuts +](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-Web-developer-must-know-part-1--net-31177)_

##### IP Addresses and Domains: Reaching a Specific Server

All computers connected to the Internet have a unique numeric address composed of four bytes of data, separated by periods (see example below). This is how computers “find” one another on the Internet.

  ```
  123.123.123.123
  ```

Of course, humans and computers communicate in different types of languages, so these numbers have to be translated into words. This is where domain registrars come in. Simply put, a domain registrar creates a link between a unique IP address (numbers) with the chosen domain name (words). When a domain name is entered into a browser, the browser performs a Domain Name System (DNS) Lookup to match the letters with the IP address.

| Domain Name | IP Address |
| --- | --- |
| apple.com | 17.172.224.47 |
| facebook.com | 31.13.65.1 |
| google.com | 216.58.192.46 |

Every Internet provider has a cached list of all registered domains and their corresponding IP addresses.  So when you type something like “apple.com” into the browser, the browser in essence asks the DNS server, "What is the IP address of the characters ‘apple.com’?" The DNS server responds, "17.172.224.47," and the browser then connects to IP address 17.172.224.47.

The process is similar to using street addresses for finding a house, rather than using Latitude and Longitude coordinates.

<a name="install2"></a>
### GitHub (10 min)

We will be using the GitHub service to share some of our code. We will learn
about the underlying technology of GitHub known as `git` in the next lesson.

- Create an account at http://github.com
- In a Terminal on your computer, run the following two commands (if you haven't already):

  ```bash
  git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"
  git config --global user.email "YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS"
  ```

  (source: [GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/))

- Follow [these
  instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/)
  to create a new _SSH Key_ (a special, very secure, key which allows your
  laptop access to your github account without having to remember your github
  password)
- Add your new SSH Key to GitHub following [these
  instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/)
- Verify your key works by running the following:

  ```bash
  // FOR GITHUB.COM
  ssh git@github.com
  ```
  
  You should see output similar to:
  
  ```
  Hi <you>! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
  Connection to github.com closed.
  ```
  
- Add an SSH key to your GA GitHub Enterprise account... When you've finished the steps above, walk back through the steps above starting at **Add your new SSH Key to GitHub**. When you get to **Verify your key works by running the following** try this command: 

  ```bash
  // FOR GA GITHUB ENTERPRISE
  ssh -T git@git.generalassemb.ly
  ```

### Brew, Git, Node, and Sublime Text (35 min)

You will need to install certain tools that will be used throughout the course. The installation instructions vary depending on whether you have a Mac, Windows, or Linux machine.

5. __Ensure NPM is updated__

Node has a handy package manager, which we will using frequently. It comes with Node, but NPM is updated more frequently; you will always need to have the most up-to-date version.

  ```bash
  npm install npm -g
  ```

6. __Install Sublime Text 3__

Sublime Text can be found [here](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) and is available for all platforms, but you are free to use any code editor you choose. Popular choices include [Atom](http://atom.io) (Mac and Windows) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/#alt-downloads) (all platforms).

When you’re done, raise your hand and ask a member of the instructional team to verify that the installation was successful.

#### Windows

1. __Install GitBash for Windows__

[Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)

2. __Install Git__

Git is used to track the state of your code over time. [GitHub](https://github.com) has built its platform on Git technology. We will be using both Git and GitHub in this class to distribute code, submit assignments, and offer feedback.
Git can be downloaded and installed from [this](https://git-scm.com/download/win) URL.

3. __Configure Git__

In order to interact with Git, you'll need to first open the Git Bash utility. A quick way to access this terminal is by right clicking your desktop and choosing "Git Bash".

Copy and paste the following two commands (separately) into your terminal. Replace the name and email address values with your own.

  ```bash
  git config --global user.name "Steve Jobs"
  git config --global user.email "steve@apple.com"
  ```

  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install sublime-text-installer
  ```

You’re all set! Test it out with `subl` and  ask a member of the instructional team to verify that the installation was successful.


### Helpful Debugging Tips

__Error installing due to permissions__

Permissions issues are common when installing programs on the terminal. In order to install command line utilities, you need to be signed into a user account on your computer with administrator-level rights. If you have trouble with this, please ask a member of the instructional team for help.

__Google is your friend__

Even experienced programmers occasionally need to look up error messages on Google. If you experience an error, it’s likely that someone else has experienced the error, as well. To find the fix, copy and paste the error message into Google, but remove content specific to your computer to ensure the accuracy of your search. You will most likely find a reference to your specific error. StackOverflow is a trustworthy reference.


>__Common Issues and Fixes:__

>We recommend the following remedies to issues that commonly arise during the installation of command line utilities:

>* Mac users may run into the problem of an outdated version of Git installed with Xcode being given precedence in the terminal. If you experience this issue, you’ll need to adjust your shell path by following the instructions under "Trumping Xcode's Older Git" [in this article](http://coolestguidesontheplanet.com/install-update-latest-version-git-mac-osx-10-9-mavericks/).

>* Mac users running OS 10.11 or later may need to [disable the System Integrity Protection](http://osxdaily.com/2015/10/05/disable-rootless-system-integrity-protection-mac-os-x/) on their machine before installing certain command line utilities.

>* Students experiencing an EACCES error should change directory permissions to install Node and npm without the need to use sudo:
`$ sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/lib/node_modules`

>* Students with Homebrew installed on their machines should run `brew update` in order to get the latest version of Homebrew.

>* Students who need to update their installations of npm can run `npm install -g npm`.

>* Students with an existing, outdated installation of Node can update their install by following the directions above (i.e., using the package installer).

## Thinking Like a Programmer (25 min)

In order to become a great programmer, you have to think like a computer. Essentially, you have to think in code. The first step, is to write down whatever you want your computer to do in plain English or pseudocode.

Pseudocode is an outline of a program, written in a form that can easily be converted into real programming statements. Pseudocode can be neither compiled nor executed, and there are no real formatting or syntax rules. It is simply the critical first step in producing the final code. The benefit of pseudocode is that it enables the programmer to concentrate on the flow of a program without being distracted by the syntactic details of a particular programming language. In fact, a programmer can write pseudocode before even knowing which programming language will be used for the final implementation.

Citation: [Webopedia](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/P/pseudocode.html)

### Pseudocode Exercise

Write the pseudocode for a program that controls a light that changes color based on user input. Imagine the light has three different-colored buttons—red, blue, and yellow. When a user touches one of the buttons, the light changes to the corresponding color. If the selected color is touched again, the light turns off. You do not have to write any actual JavaScript for this exercise.

> The purpose of this exercise is to introduce the process of basic programming. Follow the tips below:
* Provide some background on pseudocode and why we use it.
* Explain that proper pseudocode should be written as a series of steps.
* Start the exercise as a class. Encourage participation as you kick off the exercise, then have the class break into pairs to complete it.
* Come together as a group and have the pairs present their pseudocode line by line. Highlight variables, conditionals, and loops.
* Ask groups to identify common patterns and problems.
* Prompt students to consider communication differences between code and people.

## Conclusion (10 min)

Make sure the lesson objectives have been met.

* Summarize the client-server model.
* Explain the difference between the Internet and the WebWorld Wide Web.
* How was this installation process different than using a GUI? Why did we do it this way?
* What questions do you have about the course or the specific tools we installed today?
