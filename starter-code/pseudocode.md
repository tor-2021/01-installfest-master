## Pseudocode Code Along

### Prompt

Write the pseudocode for a program for that controls a light that can change color based on user input. Imagine that we have 3 different colored buttons (red, blue and yellow) and if a user taps one of the colored buttons the light changes to the selected color. If the selected color is tapped again, the light turns off.

### Instructional Design Tips

* Give some background on pseudocode and why we use it. (Refer to the lesson plan).
* Start the exercise as a group as a class, trying to encourage participation and kicking things off together.
* Then break off into pairs to complete the exercise.
* Finally come together as a group and have different pairs present their pseudocode line by line.
